# COMET-ATOMIC-Schema
This project focuses on leveraging COMET-ATOMIC-2020, a commonsense knowledge base, to create schemas for tracking and updating the state of a story as it progresses. A schema is a structured representation used to hold facts and track changes over time, enabling AI systems to perform commonsense reasoning.
